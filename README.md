# Numerical Neuron Model Using Hodgkin Huxley Dynamics

A MATLAB project that provides a numerical interface and simulation of the Hodgkin Huxley action potential model within a neuron as a circuit, described in the paper that models the [Numerical and Electronic Neuronal Action Potential Model](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Monty_Hall_problem) by Raul Jordan and Andy Tran.

## The Problem

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is
> a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's
> behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do
> you want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Taken from the wikipedia article: The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle (Gruber, Krauss and others), loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975 (Selvin 1975a), (Selvin 1975b). It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990 (vos Savant 1990a):
