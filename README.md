# Numerical Neuron Model Using Hodgkin Huxley Dynamics

A MATLAB project that provides a numerical interface and simulation of the Hodgkin Huxley action potential model within a neuron as a circuit, described in the paper that models the [Numerical and Electronic Neuronal Action Potential Model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/01toz2hazkup4z2/NeuronModel.pdf?dl=0) by Raul Jordan and Andy Tran.
